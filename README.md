Create the tables and insert data from the following files [Create Tables] [Insert Data]. If you are working on the Oracle database adjust the insert script dates and number formats.

1. The HR department wants a query to display the last name, job identifier (JOB_ID), hire date and employee number for each employee, with the employee number as the first value. Specify the alias STARTDATE for the HIRE_DATE column.

2. HR requires a query to display all unique job identifiers (JOB_ID) from the EMPLOYEES table. Duplicates are to be avoided.

3. The HR department wants more meaningful column headings for the reports related to employees. Use the statement from output 3.1 and give the columns the headings Emp #, Employee, Job and Hire Date. Run the query again.

4. For budget purposes, HR needs a report that shows the last name and salary for employees earning more than $12,000. Run the query.

5. Create a report to show the last name and department number for the employee with employee number 176.

6. Create a report to show the last name, job identifier (JOB_ID) and hire date for all employees. Sort the query in ascending order by hire date.

7. View last names and department numbers of all employees in Department 20, sorted alphabetically by last name in ascending order.

8. Create a query that displays last names, salaries and commissions of all employees whose commission is 20%. Give the columns the headings Employee, Monthly Salary and Commission.
